# castpixel's STOMP
a simple tool that uses a smarphone accelerometer (android or iOS) to play stomping sounds for armors, robots, etc.

It uses two axes of detection, Z for stomping and X for general torso clangs. It also adds a trail of jingling metal after each movement (could be replaced with piston sounds for a robot walk)

How to use: open in Construct 3 (free version is fine) directly on your mobile device and run it.

Whenever you start it, shake the device vigorously on all axes, to calibrate the max values for your accelerometer. Adjust the horizontal and vertical indicators by dragging, so you get the sensitivity you need. Then strap it on your upper torso and walk around.
